Introduction
The Seed Prediction Model aims to categorize wheat kernels into three different varieties (Kama, Rosa, Canadian) based on seven real-valued attributes, including area, perimeter, compactness, length, width, asymmetry coefficient, and length of kernel groove. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains 210 instances.
