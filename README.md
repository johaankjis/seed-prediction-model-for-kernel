Seed Prediction Model
This repository contains code for a Seed Prediction Model that identifies the type of wheat kernel based on geometrical properties. The model includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering using KMeans, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.

Introduction
The Seed Prediction Model aims to categorize wheat kernels into three different varieties (Kama, Rosa, Canadian) based on seven real-valued attributes, including area, perimeter, compactness, length, width, asymmetry coefficient, and length of kernel groove. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains 210 instances.

Usage
To run the Seed Prediction Model, you'll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn). You can clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to run the model.
